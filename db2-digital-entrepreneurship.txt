To identify: does your business act in ICT sector, offer IT products and services
			 or rely on IT to create products and services?
But what really matters is if IT is crucial to your business and plays what roles

*A non-exclusive list of things specific to IT startups*
- dotcom boom and bust
- immateriality
- cumulativeness
- network effect
  explains
  - source of first-mover advantage
  - the existence of winner-takes-all-markets
  - the evolution and success of companies like Skype or Facebook
- ecosystems
- outsourcing/offshoring
- open source
(
- scaling
- marginal cost is zero (copies)
- reusability of software
)

imitability vs. excludability
protection mechanisms
- formal: patents, registered designs/trademarks, copyright
- informal: secrecy, complexity pf design, accesses, ...

A clever idea is not enough, need:

1. Appropriability conditions

2. Complementary assets (required by innovation), which startups lack:
- specialized: value for a specific innovation, can be useful independently, a company's nerwork
- co-specialized: repair for rotary engine, little standalone value
- generic: energy for computer

Teece's model

It's hard in software to prevent being copied.
Easy in some industries like tires (keep ingredients as secrecy)

Co-operate vs. compete:
- collaborate: Go trough the market for ideas: liscense, alliance, acquisition
  Pros:                          | Cons:
  less competition for rents     | expensive and time-consumig finding partners
  avoid costs of catching up     | really credible threats?
  build on existing competencies | paradox of disclosure: know need to buy means don't need to
  new skilled personal           | IPR (Intellectual property rights) problem 
- compete: ... products
  
Perfect exam question:
If a company like polarstern is IT startup?
Reason why it is or isn't a IT startup?
Tell me what you opinion which it is and why?
4 points for 4 things

Porter's Five Forces Framework is a method of analysing the competitive environment(atractiveness) of a business:

					             Bargaining Power of Suppliers
					                          |
                                    |
Threats of new entrants --- Industry rivalry ---Threat of subsitutes
					                			    |
					                			    |
					             Bargaining Power of Buyers
