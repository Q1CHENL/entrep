Bridging the AI Business Gap - Nadiem von Heydebrand

Problem: massive AI investment, but 80% failed. There is a gap betwen business and AI
- untapped und misunderstood business potential
- misaligned between AI capabilities and business requirements
- lack of effective metrics to communicate data product impact
-> invisible data impact

up tp 20% in cost reduction, >10% in revenue increases potential

-> Delight: a data product management software
close the gap:
1. co-create business opportunities effectively: business <-(transparency)-> data products
2. streamline your portfolio for transparency: minimize duplicate work
3. manage adoption actively for value generation
   Data Product Management Loop:
 ->  Exploration -> validation -> implementation -> adoption
