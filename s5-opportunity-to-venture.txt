START -> build (lead to code, MVP) (unit tests) -> measure (lead to date) (deployment)

Startups succeed that build and iterate quickly before they run out of resources

Key lean startup points:
- vision, theory of value, from which derive a course of action, don't start from nothing, must assume customers exit
- really risk endeavor to build the entire thing and then test whether you are right, do tests and hypothese
  -> results need to be interpreted with caution (false negative, false positive)
- adapt based on what you haved learnt: presevere, pivot or perish

Market Entry:
new entry: new/established product to new/established market, creating organization

Entry strategy for exploitation:
lead time: first time operates with limited competition, can erect barriers:
customer loyalty, switching costs, product uniqueness, access to supply and distribution
first mover advantages includes more: less competitive rivalry, opportunity to gain expertises, ...

first mover disadvantages:
- market uncertainty: size, potential
- technology uncertainty: performance 
Risk reduction: market scope (customer groups), and imitation, narrow scope, broad scope across many market segments

- uncertainty for customers: value for customers, need ad, hightlighting benefits over substitutions,
                             create frame of ref for potential customers, educate customers through demonstrations/docs

- liabilities of newness (disadvantages): costs of learning, responsibilities conflicts, informal communication structure

										  need to educate employee, resolve conflicts, capitalize Advantages of newness:
										  quick to learn new knowledge in a changing environment without long process
