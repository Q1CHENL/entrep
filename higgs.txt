Lessons from HIGGS: Challenges & Key Takeaways  

Key Problems Encountered  

1. Technology Issues  
- The HIGGS app relied heavily on stable Wi-Fi, but many event locations (sports arenas, clubs) had weak or no internet.  
- The app initially worked only on Android, limiting adoption in iPhone-dominated markets.  
- Streaming stability was inconsistent, requiring technical refinements.  

2. Market Uncertainty & Scalability Challenges  
- Despite positive feedback, HIGGS struggled to find a niche where they could scale profitably.  
- One-time events (conferences, product launches) provided initial traction but lacked repeat business.  
- Large companies (e.g., Sky, Vodafone) were interested but unwilling to commit unless HIGGS proved market demand.  

3. User Engagement & Adoption Issues  
- Sports teams were excited about the concept but had little to no budget for marketing or live-streaming.  
- At live events, spectators preferred watching rather than filming, leading to a lack of user-generated content.  
- Music and club events faced logistical issues, as DJs and promoters were too busy to engage with the product.  

4. Competitive Landscape  
- Professional filming teams offered superior quality but were expensive.  
- Free social media streaming (YouTube, Facebook Live) provided stiff competition.  
- Similar multi-perspective apps existed but lacked HIGGS’ seamless integration.  

5. Operational Bottlenecks  
- The original system required the HIGGS team to be present at events, making it impractical to scale.  
- Without an automated or self-service model, expansion required significant manpower.  

Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned  

1. Technology Must Be Robust & Scalable  
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility (iOS & Android) is critical for adoption.  
- Reliable connectivity solutions (offline recording, 5G integration) could mitigate Wi-Fi dependency.  

2. Finding the Right Market Fit is Crucial  
- Startups should validate demand before committing to a market.  
- A market that is excited about a product doesn’t always mean it will pay for it.  
- Recurring revenue models (subscriptions, licensing) are preferable over one-time event-based models.  

3. User Incentives & Engagement Matter  
- Simply providing a platform is not enough—users need a strong reason to participate.  
- Financial incentives (paying users per good livestream) could increase engagement but add cost concerns.  
- A network of freelancers might provide a balance between quality and affordability.  

4. Automation & Self-Service are Key for Scalability  
- If a product requires the team to be physically present, growth becomes highly constrained.  
- A more automated approach (AI-driven camera selection, cloud-based content management) could improve scalability.  

5. Monetization Strategies Must Be Clear from the Start  
- Businesses should define a clear revenue model early on.  
- Relying on external funding or large corporations’ interest without proven demand can be risky.  

Conclusion  
HIGGS had a strong technological foundation and market interest but faced critical hurdles in technology reliability, 
market fit, user engagement, and scalability. Their journey highlights the importance of resilient technology, clear
monetization, scalable operations, and deep market validation before committing fully to a business model.
