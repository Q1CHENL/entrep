How can I organize my (growing) venture?

Growth is: revenue/sales, profit, employee, asset, market cap, ip growth

structure lens, communications within company (different levels, ceo might not know what workers do),
people of different skill sets need to fit (e.g programmer and salesmen), most initiatives of changes
in companies sampling of dependent veriables and near-death experience (mistakes), hire people of
skills and experience

heterogenous vs homongenity: does not really matter, know what you wanna do

friends as co-founder? -> it depends, have to know the people really well, consensus matters
information flow is crucial, having a strong and recognizable culture within the company

The problem a company struggles is not that not having a good strategy, but not having a good structrue,
even while having the right strategy.

Imprinting: founders' legacy - can be good or bad and different at different times
HR Issues servere for startups, exacerbated bu growth
- essential role of the founding teams- personnel is often the key resources
- managing and leading appropriately key to successful growth

<Ali Abdaal: Organization design struggles>
Books are useful.
Managing is a lot of work.
Mid-20 people don't have experience in management
What orgnization structure do we need? waterfall, little squads?
What method do we use? Sprint?
