Coming up with good ideas:

Truly novel ideas are inherently uncertain

uncertainty:
- knowledge of cause-effect relationships missing or unclear
- multiple, equally important sub-goals, unclear preference ordering
- unawareness of lack of important knowledge

Deciding what opportunity to pursue requires your own judgement

Realizing novel ideas is far from a linear process

Where to start: opportunity identification

- Knowledge: prior relevant experiences(particular opportunity), other experiences(other opportunity), no experiences,
			 can be restricting, need creativity to overcome
- Networks: led to ideas: friends and family > potential customers > suppliers/distributors > investors/lenders
- Creativity: the generation of ideas, insight or problem solutions that are novel and potentially useful
              can be reactive or proactive, difficult to measure and assess, requires deliberate actions
- Changes in the environment: technology, economic, political, social, demographic, demand pull, technology push, ...

Quantity matters: to have many ideas, tho most sucks!

Creativity techniques: 
- WIBNI -> Wouldn't it be nice if 
- Conceptual combination: An idea can be composed of lots of other ideas 
- Checklist method: other use? minify? rearrange? ... working transdisciplinary, different perspectives, select -> integrate (of knowledge)
- Six thinking hats: process, facts, feelings, creativity, benefits, cautions

Ideas evolve. Iteration is key: sketch -> feedback -> critique -> iterate/implement

Prototyping: approximation of the intended novel outcome
- general function: visualize
- specific function: evaluate

Build common understanding of key aspects of an idea: communicate
Test a specific aspect of an idea: MVP (Mininum viable product) (users willing to pay)

Fail early and often: value of early screening, reduce uncertainty

Good ideas are not dependant on genius and luck

Committing to an opportunity is not random, also likely not purely objective

Problems in search of solutions & solutions in search of problems

Sources of opportunities:
- be ware of and learn tech, political, social, demographic changes
- Anticipate consequences
- think of potential oppotunities

Rarely, the initial ideas will be exactly what will be your business
