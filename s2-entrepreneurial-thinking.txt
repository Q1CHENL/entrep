Entrepreneurial thinking: make decisions under uncertainty

Cognitive adaptibility:
- dynamic
- flexible
- self-regulating
- engage multiple decision frameworks
- sense and process changes in environment and act on them

metacognitive awareness: reflect upon, understand and control one's own thinking and learning

How? -> ask quesitons of
- comprehension: nature of the environment
- connection: think about similarities and differences with situations previously faced and solved
- strategic: strategies for solving the problem or pursuing the opportunity
- reflection: understanding and feelings as progress

Risk: probability of an outcome is possible to calculate
Uncertainty: ...not possible to determine or unknowable

To cope with uncertainty:
effectuation process(preferred): start with what one has and selects among possible outcomes (expected return, competition, plan)
causal process: start with a desired outcome and focus on means to that (affordable loss, partnership, act, surprises)
