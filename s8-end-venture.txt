How do I end the venture?

Failure rate: 50%-80% within the first 5-7 years
Reasons:
- overoptimism
- insufficient planning
- wrong market assessment
- missing competencencies in marketing, finance, HRSS

most ventures fail simply because ran out of money

It is hard to analyze own failure and learn from it.

There is no shame in quiting, it is pivoting, different from giving up.

"exit" may be for founders as well as for investors

Grief recovery:
- loss-oriented(think about what happened): working through and process loss exprience, break emotional bonds to the loss
- restoration-oriented(just feel good): focus on moving forward, avoid stress from major loss
oscillate between these 2: benefit from both and minize cost	

For successful ventures, exit of the founder may still be the norm
- might be partly demanded by VC
- most common exit modes (trade sales, buyout) implay change of owenership

LBO: Leveraged buy-out: use debt to acquire teh compnay and the debt
     is secured and repaid through the acquired firm (assets, money generated)
     (often used by Private Equity Funds)

Assets stripping/divesture: 
Asset stripping refers to selling off a company's assets to improve returns for
equity investors, often a financial investor, a "corporate raider", who takes 
over another company and then auctions off the acquired company's assets.

Management buy-out: current managers acquire the firm and continue it
Management buy-in: outside managers take over the firm
