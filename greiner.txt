Greiner - Evolution and revolution as orgnizations grow

1. Critical questions overlooked by manager in haste to grow:
   - Where has our orgnization been?
   - Where is it now?
   - What do the answers to these questions mean for where it is going?

2. The behavior of individuals is determined primarily by past events and experiences,
   rather than by what lies ahead.

3. each developmental phases as companies grow:
   a period of evolution with steady growth and stability -> revolutionary period of substantial orgnizational turmoil and change

4. Five dimensions of orgnization: 
   - age: management problems and principles are rooted in time, practices need to change, managerial attitudes need to update

   - size: problems and solutions tend to change markedly as the number of its employees and its sales volume increase
           new functions, hierarchy, more interrelated jobs

   - stages of evolution: prolonged, quiet growth with modest adjustments

   - stages of revolution: turbulent times, need to abandon past practices and make major orgnizational changes, which however may
                           also become a major problem in a later period
     
   - growth rate of the industry: the speed of orgnization experiencing evolution and revolution is closely related to the market 
                                  environment of its industry, which affect how easy to resolve severe revolutions
    
5. Phases of growth: creativity -(leadership)-> direction -(autonomy)-> delegation -(control)-> coordination -(red tape)-> collaboration -> (?)
   (in the parenthesis are the crisis between stages)
   
   Each phase is a result of previous one and the cause of next phase. 
   For each phase, managers are limited in what they can do in growth is to occur

   Phase 1: Creativity
    	      Emphasis is product and market. Communication is frequent and informal. Long hours of work and modest salaries.
    	      Decisions and motivitions are sensitive to market and customers. As grows, those become the problems, crisis of
    	      leadership occurs. Temparement of founders can be the problem. Formal communication, additional capital and a
    	      strong business manager is needed.
    	    
   Phase 2: Direction
            functional and orgnizational structrue, accounting systems, formal communications, hierarchy of titles and positions
            -> lower-level employee restricted by cumbersome and centralized hierarchy -> crisis of autonmomy -> more delegation 
            to lower-level managers (decentrilization of structrue)
            
   Phase 3: Delegation
            - much greater resposibility for managers of plants and market
            - bonuses to motivate
            - top-level limit to managing: periodic reports from the field
            - management focuses acquiring ourside enterprises fit with decentralized units
            - communication from top is infrequent: correspondence, telephone, brief visit
            delegations are motivated and perform very well with high degree of freedom, top-level lose control over a highly diversity
            -> try to regain control and usually fail, need coordination

   Phase 4: Coordination
            - decentralized units -> merged groups
            - formal planning procudures and intensive review
            - careful captital expenditures
            - product groups treated as investment center
            - e.g data processing in headquarter, daily operating decision remain decentralized
            - stock options, profit sharing to encourage to identify as a whole
            bureaucratic systems, procedures over problem solving, line managers and staff complain about the unfamiliarity of conditions
            -> red-tape crisis
            
   Phase 5: Collaboration
            - interpersonal collaboration
            - solving problems quickly through team action
            - teams are combined to handles specific tasks
            - staff experts reduced, reassigned and combine to consult field units
            - matrix-type structure
            - frequent conferences of key managers
            - educational systems
            - real-time information systems
            - economic rewards
            - encourage experimenting new practices

            ?-crissis might centers around psychological saturation, physical exhaust, intensity of teamwork, pressure 
            for innovation
            solution can be periodic rest, dual structures: habit structure & reflective structure, employees move back and forth
            sabbaticals for employees, moving managers in and out for hot-spot works, relexation facilities
            Chinese practice: executives spend time in lower-level jobs 



6. Guidelines for managers of growing orgnizations
   - Know where you are in the developmental sequence: to recognize the time to change and wrong solution
     should not skip phases or avoid revolutions
     
   - Recognize the limited range of solutions: apply different solutions in different stages, be prepared
     to dismantle/even step down before too late 

   - Realize that solutions breed new problems: helps to evaluate problems from a historical understanding

   "By learning more about history, we may do a better job in the future."
