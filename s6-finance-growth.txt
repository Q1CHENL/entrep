Session 6: Finance & Growth

1. Startup valley of death: idea -> R&D -> technology transfer -> product launch -> product success -> business success
   the cost is maxed at product success, easy to die before business success
   The money for the first steps are from bootstrapping and bank

2. Venture: a new business undertaking or project, typically involving some degree of risk, that 
   is aimed at achieving a specific goal, often financial gain.

1. Own money
2. Families, friends and fools, who just like give money to new things (FFF) (contract helps!) 
3. Revenue generated from the business (bootstrapping)
4. Supporting from government with or without some obligations.

5. Crowd funding: promise product, pre-order, middle age men (games, smart watch, tesla, social space donation)
6. Fund raising: get money from venture capitalists(pooled of money from different sources, invest a large amount
   make money by selling shares, not profits), angel investors (smaller amount), growth expections
